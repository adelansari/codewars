## What is Kata?

On Codewars, kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.

## Ranks

Codewars kata levels are divided into two classes of ranks, **kyu** and **dan**, which are divided in 8 levels each. the ranks are used to indicate the proficiency of users and the difficulty of kata. the levels of kyu and dan are in increasing order of proficiency/difficulty. the kata ranks are as follows:

- white (beginner) 8 kyu
- yellow (novice) 6 kyu
- blue (competent) 4 kyu
- purple (proficient) 2 kyu
- brown (expert) 1 kyu
- black (master) 1 dan to 8 dan
